# Askyblock & AcidIsland Issues
This repository is for handling issues related to ASkyBlock or AcidIsland.

## WARNING
If you post abusive comments your account blocked! Be polite and remember that this is a volunteer-driven project.

## Bug reports
Create an issue to submit a bug report. Before you do, check the other issues - maybe it was already submitted.
If it's not a [Duplicate], we'll investigate the bug you reported. You **should** give us as much information as possible in order to make us able to replicate it. We might need you to tell us more about the bug you encountered, so please regularly check if there is a tag [Waiting for response] on your issue.

Keep in mind we **do not support old ASkyBlock version**, and we will close your issue if we don't receive answers for more than a week.

Here is a list of what you must include in your bug report :
* Server & ASkyBlock version
* If this is an error in the console, include the error log
* What does the bug consist of?
* How did this happen?

Here is a list of questions you should answer to be sure you don't forget anything :
* Are you using a Proxy? (BungeeCord, ...) ; or are you running on offline mode?
* Does it often happen?
* Did you update/install a plugin?
* What plugins are you using on your server?
* Have you got screenshots or videos of the bug? (if yes : don't forget to add them to the issue).

## Feature Requests
Create an issue to submit a feature request. Before you do, check the closed issues - maybe it was already submitted.
Even though your idea may be awesome, we may not choose to do it. You can always fork the code and do it yourself if that happens.
We will try to give you a decision on whether we will do a feature or not within about a week of submission. Here are a few possible reasons for why we will not do it:

* It's a rubbish idea - sorry, sometimes they are.
* It'll make the plugin too big, or make game play too complex - remember a lot of players are not even in their teens
* The idea will change the game too much, e.g., make it SkyWars, instead of SkyBlock
* It will cause support issues for admins
* It will add lag
* It's too big a job and we don't have the time or the resources to do it
* Etc.

We reserve the right not to give a reason. Again, you can always fork the code.
